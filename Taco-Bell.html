		<p>The Cheesy Gordita Crunch is the most delectable thing that you will ever taste. A pillowy, gordita shell 
			wrapped around a crunchy taco, and filled with creamy cheese creates a beautiful concoction of flavor. When you 
			take a bite into it, you will know where every hard-earned penny went.</p>

		<p>A common issue with cheesy concoctions is that one bite causes everything to fall apart. The Cheesy Gordita Crunch sidesteps this issue 
			with the use of the soft shell to contain the hard shell and everything inside.</p>
